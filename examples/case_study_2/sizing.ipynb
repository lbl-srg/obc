    "# Sizing assumptions and methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sizing and Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present the set of assumptions driving our component sizing and controls parametrization decisions regarding both demand and supply sides of the system. As the paper primarily aims to demonstrate tools and techniques to evaluate control sequences and system configurations, we looked to define a reasonable set of sizing parameters in terms of loading, component nominal capacities, and hydraulics to allow for the controls performance comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the demand side we take as a design assumption a data center with a total thermal output of 500 kW, including sources outlined in \\citep{Rasmussen2007}, such as IT loads, UPSs, lighting, power distribution, and personnel. For simplicity, we assume the data center room is adiabatic and there is no humidity control. As in the PUE calculation the IT load refers to power consumption of computational equipment only, we assume that non-IT equipment makes on average 20\\% of the data center zone load.\n",
    "\n",
    "We size the cooling system to, with sufficient reliability, meet the center's cooling load at the given location. Based on the current status of the technology, we select a server room  air temperature (cold aisle) $T_{z,s,set}$, of 27$\\degree{C}$ in the main analysis, as originally set for the plant in \\citep{WetterZuoNouiduiPang2014} and also mentioned in \\citep{AshraeTC99}, and in addition perform a 25$\\degree{C}$ and 29$\\degree{C}$ sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high air supply temperature in conjunction with the selected climate's wet-bulb outdoor air temperature allows a plant with a generously sized WSE and a chiller sized tightly to the load to achieve a near 2N cooling capacity redundancy. We selected a chiller available in the ModelicaBuildings library (\\citep{WetterZuoNouiduiPang2014}), a 471 kW fixed speed chiller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal air and water mass flow assumptions are:\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "    \\setlength\\itemsep{-0.5em}\n",
    "    \\item The air flow rate in the supply air loop is 33 $kg/s$. It is calculated assuming a temperature difference across the coil of 15 K. With these parameters the supply air fan achieves an airflow efficiency ratio (AER) of 0.11 $W/(m^3/h)$, similar to the first example provided in \\citep{Stulz2021}.\n",
    "    \\item The water flow rate in the CHW loop is 12 $kg/s$. It is selected as both a value with a theoretical temperature difference of 10 K and one close to the selected chiller model design condition. The chosen value also fits the rule from \\citep{Trane2014}.\n",
    "    \\item The water flow rate in the CW loop is 20 $kg/s$ for each chiller condenser and WSE. The value is near the chiller model design condition and falls within the standard industry range (\\citep{Ahri550_590_2020}).\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal pressure drops through heat exchangers, pipes, and fittings are assumed to be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "    \\setlength\\itemsep{-0.5em}\n",
    "    \\item Chiller evaporator has a pressure drop of 19 $kPa$, while for the chiller condenser we assume 42 $kPa$. To calculate the values we developed and applied a scaling approach to a chiller specification of \\citep{Carrier2014}, and corrected the values to fit our chiller's nominal cooling capacity, CW and CHW flows. We assume that the tubes of the shell-and-tube HX for a comparably slightly smaller chiller, as the one we applied in the model, would be a bit narrower such that at a cooling capacity proportion adjusted nominal flow they would cause the same pressure drop as specified in the source. Then we scale the nominal pressure drops from the data with the square of the ratio of the model nominal flows versus the adjusted flows based on the data. The square relationship stems from the flow velocity member of the Bernoulli's equation.\n",
    "    \\item The cooling tower pressure drop is primarily due to overcoming the height difference based on \\citep{BAC2013}. Assuming a 1.5 m tall cooling tower, its pressure drop is estimated at 15 $kPa$.\n",
    "    \\item Cooling coil - assuming discrepancies in airflow and water flow are accounted for through placing coils similar to those provided in \\citep{Trane2019} in parallel to each other, we adopted pressure drop values close to the source values. On the air side we assume the coil as the main flow resisting element, while any short ducts and plenum add about $5-10\\%$ to obtain a total air-side pressure drop of 200 $Pa$. On the CHW side we assume a pressure drop of 24 $kPa$.\n",
    "    \\item For the WSE we assume the same CW flow and thus the same pressure drop on the CW side as for the chiller condenser, 42 $kPa$, as suggested in \\citep{Taylor2014}. We then scale the CW WSE pressure drop according to the CHW-side flow, to obtain the CHW-loop WSE pressure drop of 15 $kPa$.\n",
    "    \\item We assume pipe diameters of 6 inch (\\~15 $cm$) for CW, and 5 inch (\\~13 $cm$) for CHW loop. The CHW contains 30 $m$ of piping for both base and alternative case. The alternative controller is assumed to also have 30 $m$ of pipes in the CW loop, while the base controller has 10 $m$ of pipes in each chiller condenser and WSE CW-side loops, with another 20 $m$ of piping in the cooling tower loop. The piping pressure drops were selected based on pressure drop tables from \\citep{AdvantageEngineering2021} and doubled to encompass both piping and simple fittings excluding modulated valves. The resulting values are: 4.5 $kPa$ in the CHW loop, and in the CW loop - 4.3 $kPa$ in the alternative and 5.7 $kPa$ in the base case. 6 $kPa$ are added to account for any modulating control valves (\\citep{BelimoAircontrols2021}).\n",
    "    % *mg convert above to Pa/m for short version\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "The cooling tower approach is assumed at 4 $K$, which is slightly more conservative than in the examples from \\citep{PGANDE2012}. Based on a sizing rule stemming from \\citep{Ahri550_590_2020}, that relates the tower fan power to the chilling capacity, the tower fan is sized at 6.5 $kW$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the main controller parameters set in both cases to ensure comparability:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "    \\setlength\\itemsep{-0.5em}\n",
    "    \\item $T_{chw,s,set}$ is limited between 5.56 and 22$\\degree{C}$\n",
    "    \\item $dp_{chw,set}$ ranges from 12970 to 129700 $Pa$\n",
    "    \\item Temperature dead-band for the chiller enable hysteresis switch equals 2.2 $K$\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "The configurations assume that at commissioning the minimum pump speeds (base) and chiller modulating isolation valve (alternative) would be determined and set to maintain the minimum flow through the chiller condenser, and also minimum lift. It is recommended to always size the equipment in a climate-specific way to avoid additional piping or control equipment that otherwise may be needed to maintain the chiller within the manufacturer prescribed operating range.\n",
    "\n",
    "All controller parameters can be further explored in the open sourced models, also on this branch.\n",
