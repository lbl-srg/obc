Benefits to Rate Payers

Estimates of Potential Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The adoption of the technology developed in the OpenBuildingControl project
will result in improved design and implementation of building controls,
resulting in more robust and efficient operation of commercial buildings.
This will lead to more reliable provision of thermal and visual comfort
while reducing both energy costs and equipment maintenance costs :cite:`FernandezEtAl2017:1`.

The energy savings from widespread adoption of the processes and tools can be estimated as follows.
A major barrier to achieving the state’s statutory energy goals is
the failure of most commercial buildings to perform close to the technical potential
of the design and its associated equipment. An LBNL meta-study identified 16% median actual savings
from retro-commissioning :cite:`Mills2011` and a study of 481 operational issues identified in existing commercial buildings
found that control problems accounted for more than 75% of the potential energy savings :cite:`EffingerFriedmanEtAl2009`.
Therefore, we assume that around 75% of the 16% energy savings, equal to a total of 12% of energy savings,
associated with commissioning are related to controls.
Assuming that the technologies to be developed in the proposed project can save 12% in the 50% of
commercial building floor area higher than 50,000 sf, we will assume our technology can reduce energy consumption
on average across all commercial buildings by 6%.

The National savings are estimated as follows:
Commercial buildings consume annually about 4.24 quads (1240 TWh) of electricity and 2.25 quads (659 TWh) of gas. [#f1]_
The 6% savings correspond to
0.254 quads (74.4 TWh) of electricity and
0.135 quads (39.6 TWh) of gas.
Assuming a price of 0.1 $/kWh electricity
and 8 $/(1000 ft3) of gas [#f2]_ (corresponding
to 0.027 $/kWh), the cost savings would be $7.44B in electricity and $1.07B in gas.

The California savings are estimated as follows:
CA commercial building consume annually about 0.23 quads (67.1 TWh) of electricity and
1278.6 Mtherms (37.4 TWh) of gas (See Table 8-1 in :cite:`CEUS2006`).
The 6% savings correspond to
0.0152 quads (4.46 TWh) of electricity and
0.0081 quads (2.38 TWh) of gas.
Assuming the same energy costs as above,
the cost savings would be $0.45B in electricity and $0.064B in gas.



Timeframe and Assumptions for Estimated Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We assume 25% adoption in the target market five years after project completion and 75% ten years after.
If 10% of the target existing buildings have a controls retrofit each year and the new construction rate is 1.5%/yr,
then after 10 years the annual savings from existing buildings will have ramped up to about 40% of the maximum.
This will result in $160M/yr savings for California IOU ratepayers.
