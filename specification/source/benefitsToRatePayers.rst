Benefits to Rate Payers

Estimates of Potential Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The adoption of the technology developed in the OpenBuildingControl project
will result in improved design and implementation of building controls,
resulting in more robust and efficient operation of commercial buildings.
This will lead to more reliable provision of thermal and visual comfort
while reducing both energy costs and equipment maintenance costs :cite:`FernandezEtAl2017:1`.

The energy savings from widespread adoption of the processes and tools can be estimated as follows.
A major barrier to achieving the stateâ€™s statutory energy goals is
the failure of most commercial buildings to perform close to the technical potential
of the design and its associated equipment. An LBNL meta-study identified 16% median actual savings
from retro-commissioning :cite:`Mills2011` and a study of 481 operational issues identified in existing commercial buildings
found that control problems accounted for more than 75% of the potential energy savings :cite:`EffingerFriedmanEtAl2009`.
Therefore, we assume that around 75% of the 16% expected energy savings associated with commissioning relate to controls, i.e. 12%.
Assuming that the technologies being developed in the project can save 12% in the 50% of the
commercial building floor area that is in buildings larger than 50,000 sf, the estimated savings average 6% across all commercial buildings.

The California savings are estimated as follows:
the annual energy consumption of California commercial buildings is about 67.1 TWh of electricity,
equivalent to 0.64 quads (188 TWh) of source energy,
and 1278.6 Mtherms (0.13 quads, 37.4 TWh) of natural gas (see Table 8-1 in :cite:`CEUS2006`).
The estimated 6% savings correspond to 4.03 TWh of electricity,
equivalent to 0.038 quads (11.28 TWh) of source energy, and 0.00764 quads (2.24 TWh) of natural gas.
Assuming a price of 0.17 $/kWh for electricity and 8 $/(1000 ft3) for natural gas (corresponding to 0.027 $/kWh),
the cost savings would be $0.69B in electricity and $0.064B in natural gas.

The US national savings are estimated as follows:
The annual energy consumption of US commercial buildings is about 1240 TWh of electricity, equivalent to 11.9 quads (3472 TWh) of source energy,
and about 22,500 MTherms (2.25 quads, 659 TWh) of natural gas. [#f1]_
The estimated 6% savings correspond to 74.4 TWh of electricity, equivalent to 0.71 quads (208 TWh) of source energy, and
0.135 quads (39.5 TWh) of natural gas.
Assuming a price of 0.11 $/kWh for electricity and 8 $/(1000 ft3) for natural gas, the electricity cost savings would be $8.2B and
the natural gas savings $1.07B.

A value of 2.8 for the ratio of site energy to source energy has been assumed for electricity, both for California and nationally. [#f2]_

These electricity savings correspond to
25 Rosenfelds in the US and
1.5 Rosenfelds in California. [#f3]_

   Estimated benefits of OpenBuildingControl.


If we assume 75% adoption of OpenBuildingControl over the next ten years, a controls retrofit rate of 10% per year and
a new building construction rate of 1.5% per year,
then, after 10 years, the fraction of the building stock, weighted by floor area,
that is impacted by OpenBuildingControl is 21% (see :numref:`fig_est_ben`).
Assuming the potential benefit of $0.69B savings in electricity,
the estimated benefits are $146M/yr savings for California ratepayers.

         the amount needed to replace the annual generation of a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant.
