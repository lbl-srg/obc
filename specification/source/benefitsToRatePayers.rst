Estimates of Potential Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The adoption of the technology developed in the OpenBuildingControl project
will result in improved design and implementation of building controls,
resulting in more robust and efficient operation of commercial buildings.
This will lead to more reliable provision of thermal and visual comfort
while reducing both energy costs and equipment maintenance costs :cite:`FernandezEtAl2017:1`.

The energy savings from widespread adoption of the processes and tools can be estimated as follows.
A major barrier to achieving the stateâ€™s statutory energy goals is
the failure of most commercial buildings to perform close to the technical potential
of the design and its associated equipment. An LBNL meta-study identified 16% median actual savings
from retro-commissioning :cite:`Mills2011` and a study of 481 operational issues identified in existing commercial buildings
found that control problems accounted for more than 75% of the potential energy savings :cite:`EffingerFriedmanEtAl2009`.
Therefore, we assume that around 75% of the 16% energy savings, equal to a total of 12% of energy savings,
associated with commissioning are related to controls.
Assuming that the technologies to be developed in the proposed project can save 12% in the 50% of
commercial building floor area higher than 50,000 sf, we will assume our technology can reduce energy consumption
on average across all commercial buildings by 6%.

The National savings are estimated as follows:
The annual site energy consumption of commercial buildings in the US is about
4.24 quads (1240 TWh) of electricity and 2.25 quads (659 TWh) of gas. [#f1]_
The 6% savings correspond to
0.254 quads (74.4 TWh) of electricity and
0.135 quads (39.6 TWh) of gas.
Assuming a price of 0.1 $/kWh electricity
and 8 $/(1000 ft3) of gas [#f2]_ (corresponding
to 0.027 $/kWh), the cost savings would be $7.44B in electricity and $1.07B in gas.

The California savings are estimated as follows:
The annual site energy consumption of commercial buildings in California is about
0.23 quads (67.1 TWh) of electricity and
1278.6 Mtherms (37.4 TWh) of gas (See Table 8-1 in :cite:`CEUS2006`).
The 6% savings correspond to
0.0152 quads (4.46 TWh) of electricity and
0.0081 quads (2.38 TWh) of gas.
Assuming the same energy costs as above,
the cost savings would be $0.45B in electricity and $0.064B in gas.

These electricity savings correspond to
25 Rosenfelds in the US and
1.5 Rosenfeld in California. [#f3]_


Timeframe and Assumptions for Estimated Benefits

   Estimated benefits of OpenBuildingControl.


If we assume 75% adoption of OpenBuildingControl over the next ten years, a controls retrofit rate of 10% per year and
a new building construction rate of 1.5% per year,
then, after 10 years, the amount of building stock that is impacted by OpenBuildingControl is 21% (see :numref:`fig_est_ben`).
Assuming the potential benefit of $0.45B savings in electricity,
the estimated benefits are $95M/yr savings for California IOU ratepayers.

         the amount needed to replace the annual generation of a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant.
