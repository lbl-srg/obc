Example Application
-------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we compare the performance of two different
control sequences.
The objectives are
to demonstrate the setup for closed loop performance assessment,
to demonstrate how to compare control performance, and
to assess the difference in annual energy consumption.

As a test case, we used a simulation model that consists
of five thermal zones that are representative of one floor of the
new construction medium office building for Chicago, IL,
as described in the set of DOE Commercial Building Benchmarks
:cite:`DeruEtAl2011:1`.
There are four perimeter zones and one core zone.
The envelope thermal properties meet ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
The system model consist of an HVAC system, a building envelope model :cite:`WetterZuoNouidui2011:2`
and a model for air flow through building leakage
and through open doors based on wind pressure and
flow imbalance of the HVAC system :cite:`Wetter2006:2`.
Thus, at every simulation step, a full pressure drop calculation is done
to compute the air flow distribution based on damper positions, fan control signal
and fan curve.

For the base case, we implemented a control sequence published in
ASHRAE's Sequences of Operation for
Common HVAC Systems :cite:`ASHRAESeq2006:1`.
For the other case, we implemented the control sequence
published in ASHRAE Guideline 36 :cite:`ASHRAE2016`.
The main conceptual differences between the two control sequences,
which are described in more detail in :numref:`sec_con_seq_des`,
are as follows:

* The base case uses two different but constant supply air temperature setpoints
  for heating and cooling during occupied hours,
  whereas Guideline 36 case resets the supply air
  temperature setpoint based on outdoor air temperature
  and zone cooling requests, as obtained from the VAV terminal unit controllers.
  The reset is using the trim and respond logic.
* The base case resets the supply fan static pressure setpoint based
  on the VAV damper positions,
  whereas the Guideline 36 case resets the fan static pressure setpoint based
  on zone pressure requests from the VAV terminal controllers.
  The reset is using the trim and respond logic.
* The base case controls the economizer to track a mixed air
  temperature setpoint, whereas Guideline 36 controls the economizer
  based on supply air temperature control loop signal.
* The base case controls the VAV dampers based on the zone's cooling
  temperature setpoint, whereas Guideline 36 uses the heating and cooling
  loop signal to control the VAV dampers.


The next sections are as follows:
In :numref:`sec_met_cas1` we describe the methodology,
the models and the performance metrics,
in :numref:`sec_per_com_cas1` we compare the performance,
in :numref:`sec_imp_spe_cas1` we recommend improvements to the
Guideline 36 and
in :numref:`sec_dis_con_cas1` we discuss the main findings and present
concluding remarks.

Methodology
^^^^^^^^^^^

All models are implemented in Modelica, using models from
the Buildings library :cite:`WetterZuoNouiduiPang2014`.
The models are available from
https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/releases/tag/v5.0.0



HVAC Model
..........

The HVAC system is a variable air volume (VAV) flow system
with economizer and a heating and cooling coil in the air handler unit.
There is also a reheat coil and an air damper in each of the five zone
inlet branches.

:numref:`fig_vav_schematics` shows the schematic diagram of the HVAC system.

.. _fig_vav_schematics:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/vavSchematics.*

   Schematic diagram of the HVAC system.

In the VAV model, all air flows are computed based on the
duct static pressure distribution and the performance curves of the fans.
The fans are modeled as described in :cite:`Wetter2013:1`.

Envelope Heat Transfer
......................

The thermal room model computes transient heat conduction through
walls, floors and ceilings and long-wave radiative heat exchange between
surfaces. The convective heat transfer coefficient is computed based
on the temperature difference between the surface and the room air.
There is also a layer-by-layer short-wave radiation,
long-wave radiation, convection and conduction heat transfer model for the
windows. The model is similar to the
Window 5 model.
The physics implemented in the building model is further described in
:cite:`WetterZuoNouidui2011:2`.

There is no moisture buffering in the envelope, but the room volume
has a dynamic equation for the moisture content.

.. _sec_int_gai:

Internal Loads
..............

.. _fig_internal_loads:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/internal_loads.*
   :width: 700px

   Internal load schedule.

We use an internal load schedule as shown in
:numref:`fig_internal_loads`, of which
:math:`20\%` is radiant,
:math:`40\%` is convective sensible and
:math:`40\%` is latent.
Each zone has the same internal load per floor area.

Multi-Zone Air Exchange
.......................

Each thermal zone has air flow from the HVAC system,
through leakages of the building envelope (except for the core zone)
and through bi-directional air exchange through open doors that connect adjacent zones.
The bi-directional air exchange is modeled based on the differences
in static pressure between adjacent rooms at a reference height
plus the difference in static pressure across the door height
as a function of the difference in air density.
Air infiltration is a function of the
flow imbalance of the HVAC system.
The multizone airflow models are further described in
:cite:`Wetter2006:2`.



.. _sec_con_seq_des:

Control Sequences
.................

For the above models, we implemented two different control sequences, which
are described below. The control sequences are the only difference between
the two cases.

For the base case, we implemented the control sequence
*VAV 2A2-21232* of the Sequences of Operation for
Common HVAC Systems :cite:`ASHRAESeq2006:1`.
In this control sequence, the
supply fan speed is modulated to maintain a duct static pressure setpoint.
The duct static pressure setpoint is adjusted
so that at least one VAV damper is 90% open.
The economizer dampers
are modulated to track the setpoint for the mixed air dry bulb temperature.
The supply air temperature setpoints for heating and cooling are constant
during occupied hours, which may not comply with some energy codes.
Priority is given to maintain a minimum outside air volume flow rate.
In each zone, the VAV damper is adjusted to meet the room temperature
setpoint for cooling, or fully opened during heating.
The room temperature setpoint for heating is controlled by varying
the water flow rate through the reheat coil. There is also a
finite state machine that transitions the mode of operation of
the HVAC system between the modes
*occupied*, *unoccupied off*, *unoccupied night set back*,
*unoccupied warm-up* and *unoccupied pre-cool*.
Local loop control is implemented using proportional and proportional-integral
controllers, while the supervisory control is implemented
using a finite state machine.

For the detailed implementation of the control logic,
see the model `Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006
<https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v5.0.0/help/Buildings_Examples_VAVReheat.html#Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006>`_,
which is also shown in :numref:`fig_model_top_base`.

Our implementation differs from VAV 2A2-21232 in the following points:

* We removed the return air fan as the building static pressure is sufficiently
  large. With the return fan, building static pressure was not adequate.

* In order to have the identical mechanical system as for the Guideline 36 case,
  we do not have a minimum outdoor air damper, but rather controlled
  the outdoor air damper to allow sufficient outdoor air
  if the mixed air temperature control loop would yield too little outdoor
  air.


For the Guideline 36 case, we implemented the multi-zone VAV control sequence
based on :cite:`ASHRAE2016`.
:numref:`fig_vav_con_sch` shows the sequence diagram, and the detailed implementation
is available in the model `Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.Guideline36 <https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v5.0.0/help/Buildings_Examples_VAVReheat.html#Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.Guideline36>`_.

In the Guideline 36 sequence, the duct static pressure is reset using trim and respond
logic based on zone pressure reset requests, which are issued from the terminal box
controller based on whether the measured flow rate tracks the set point.
The implementation of the controller that issues these system requests
is shown in :numref:`fig_sys_req`.
The economizer dampers are modulated based on a control signal for the supply
air temperature set point, which is also used to control the heating and cooling coil valve
in the air handler unit.
Priority is given to maintain a minimum outside air volume flow rate.
The supply air temperature setpoints for heating and cooling at the air handler unit
are reset based on outdoor air temperature, zone temperature reset requests from
the terminal boxes and operation mode.

In each zone, the VAV damper and the reheat coil is controlled using the
sequence shown in :numref:`fig_dam_val_reh`, where
``THeaSet`` is the set point temperature for heating,
``dTDisMax`` is the maximum temperature difference for the discharge temperature above ``THeaSet``,
``TSup`` is the supply air temperature,
``VAct*`` are the active airflow rates for heating (``Hea``) and cooling (``Coo``),
with their minimum and maximum values denoted by ``Min`` and ``Max``.

.. _fig_dam_val_reh:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/DamperValve.*
   :width: 600px

   Control sequence for VAV terminal unit.


Our implementation differs from Guideline 36 in the following points:

* Guideline 36 prescribes "To avoid abrupt changes in equipment operation,
  the output of every control loop shall be capable of being limited
  by a user adjustable maximum rate of change, with
  a default of 25% per minute."

  We did not implement this limitation of the output as it leads to delays
  which can make control loop tuning more difficult if the output limitation
  is slower than the dynamics of the controlled process.
  We did however add a first order hold at the trim and response logic
  that outputs the duct static pressure setpoint for the fan speed.

* Not all alarms are included.

* Where Guideline 36 prescribes that equipment is enabled if a controlled quantity
  is above or below a setpoint, we added a hysteresis. In real systems, this
  avoids short-cycling due to measurement noise, in simulation, this is needed
  to guard against numerical noise that may be introduced by a solver.


Site Electricity Use
....................

To convert cooling and heating energy as transferred by the coil to site electricity
use, we apply the conversion factors from EnergyStar :cite:`EnergyStar2013`.
Therefore, for an electric chiller, we assume an average coefficient of performance (COP) of
:math:`3.2` and for a geothermal heat pump, we assume a COP of :math:`4.0`.


Simulations
...........

:numref:`fig_model_top_base` shows the top-level of the system model of the base case, and
:numref:`fig_model_top_guideline` shows the same view for the Guideline 36 model.

.. _fig_model_top_base:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/ASHRAE2006.*

   Top level view of Modelica model for the base case.

.. _fig_model_top_guideline:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/Guideline36.*

   Top level view of Modelica model for the Guideline 36 case.

The complexity of the control implementation is visible
in :numref:`fig_sys_req` which computes the temperature and pressure
requests of each terminal box that is sent to the air handler unit control.


All simulations were done with Dymola 2018 FD01 beta3 using Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit.
We used the Radau solver with a tolerance of :math:`10^{-6}`.
This solver adaptively changes the time step to control the integration error.
Also, the time step is adapted to properly simulate :term:`time events<time event>`
and :term:`state events<state event>`.

The base case and the Guideline 36 case use the same HVAC and building model,
which is implemented in the base class
``Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialOpenLoop``.
The two cases differ in their implementation of the control sequence only,
which is implemented in the models
``Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.ASHRAE2006`` and
``Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Guideline36``.

:numref:`tab_mod_sta` shows an overview of the model and simulation statistics.
The differences in the number of variables and in the number of time varying
variables reflect that the Guideline 36 control is significantly more
detailed than what may otherwise be used for simulation of what the authors
believe represents a realistic implementation of a feedback control sequence.
The entry approximate number of control I/O connections
counts the number of input and output connections among the
control blocks of the two implementations. For example,
If a P controller receives one set point, one measured quantity
and sends it signal to a limiter and the limiter output is
connected to a valve, then this would count as four connections.
Any connections inside the PI controller would not be counted,
as the PI controller is an elementary building block
(see :numref:`sec_ele_blo`) of CDL.

Performance Comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fig_cas_stu1_energy:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/energy_all.*
   :width: 600px

   Comparison of energy use. For the cases labeled :math:`\pm 50\%`, the internal gains
   have been increased and decreased as described in :numref:`sec_int_gai`.

.. _tab_site_energy:

.. include:: img/case_study1/results/site_energy.rst


:numref:`fig_cas_stu1_energy` and
:numref:`tab_site_energy` compare the annual
site HVAC electricity use between
the annual simulations with the base case control
and the Guideline 36 control.
The bars labeled :math:`\pm 50\%` were obtained with simulations in which we
changed the diversity of the internal loads.
Specifically, we reduced the internal loads for the north zone by :math:`50\%`
and increased them for the south zone by the same amount.

In this case study,
the Guideline 36 control saves around :math:`30\%`
site HVAC electrical energy. These are significant savings
that can be achieved through software only, without the need
for additional hardware or equipment.
Our experience, however, was that it is rather challenging to
program the Guideline 36 sequence due to their complex logic
that contains various mode changes, interlocks and timers.
Various programming errors and misinterpretations or ambiguities
of Guideline 36 were only discovered in closed loop simulations.
We therefore believe it is important to provide robust, validated
implementations of Guideline 36 that encapsulates the complexity for the
energy modeler and the control provider.


.. _fig_outside:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/outside.*

   Outside air temperature and global horizontal irradiation for the
   three periods that will be further used in the analysis.


:numref:`fig_outside`
shows the outside air temperature temperature :math:`T_{out}` and
the global horizontal irradiation :math:`H_{glo,hor}` for
a period in winter, spring and summer. These days will
be used to compare the trajectories of various quantities of the base case
and the Guideline 36 case.

.. _fig_TRoom_all:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/TRoom_all.*

   Room air temperatures. The white area indicates the region between the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures.

:numref:`fig_TRoom_all`
compares the time trajectories of the room air temperatures.
The figures show that the room air temperatures are controlled
within the setpoints for both cases. Small set point violations
have been observed due to the dynamic nature of the control sequence
and the controlled process.



.. _fig_vav_all:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/vav_all.*

   VAV control signals for the north and south zones.
   The white areas indicate the day-time operation.

:numref:`fig_vav_all` shows the control signals of the reheat coils :math:`y_{hea}`
and the VAV damper :math:`y_{vav}`
for the north and south zones.

.. _fig_TAHU_all:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/TAHU_all.*

   AHU temperatures.

:numref:`fig_TAHU_all` shows the temperatures of the air handler unit.
The figure shows
the supply air temperature after the fan :math:`T_{sup}`,
its control error relative to its set point :math:`T_{set,sup}`,
the mixed air temperature after the economizer :math:`T_{mix}`
and the return air temperature from the building :math:`T_{ret}`.
A notable difference is that the Guideline 36 sequence resets
the supply air temperature, whereas the base case is controlled
for a supply air temperature of :math:`10^\circ \mathrm C`
for heating and :math:`12^\circ \mathrm C` for cooling.

.. _fig_flow_signals_all:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/flow_signals_all.*

   Control signals for the supply fan, outside air damper and return air damper.

:numref:`fig_flow_signals_all` show reasonable fan speeds and economizer operation.
Note that during the winter days 5, 6 and 7, the outdoor air damper opens. However,
this is only to track the setpoint for the minimum outside air flow rate as the fan
speed is at its minimum.

.. _fig_normalized_flow_all:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/normalized_flow_all.*

   Fan and outside air volume flow rates, normalized by the room air volume.

:numref:`fig_normalized_flow_all` shows the volume flow rate of the fan
:math:`\dot V_{fan,sup}/V_{bui}`, where :math:`V_{bui}` is the volume of the building,
and of the outside air intake of the economizer :math:`\dot V_{eco,out}/V_{bui}`, expressed in air changes per hour.
Note that Guideline 36 has smaller outside air flow rates in cold winter and hot summer days.
The system has relatively low air changes per hour. As fan
energy is low for this building, it may be more efficient to increase
flow rates and use higher cooling and lower heating temperatures,
in particular if heating and cooling is provided by a heat pump and chiller.
We have however not further analyzed this trade-off.



.. _fig_TRoom_load_diversity:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/TRoom_with_without_div_IHG.*

   Outdoor air and room air temperatures for the north and south zone with
   equal internal loads, and with diversity added to the internal loads.
   The white area indicates the region between the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures.

:numref:`fig_TRoom_load_diversity` compares the room air temperatures for the
north and south zone for the standard internal loads, and the case where we
reduced the internal loads in the north zone by :math:`50\%` and increased it
by the same amount in the south zone.
The trajectories with subscript :math:`\pm 50\%` are the simulations with
the internal heat gains reduced or increased by :math:`50\%`.
The room air temperature trajectories
are practically on top of each other for winter and spring, but
the Guideline 36 sequence shows somewhat better setpoint tracking
during summer.
Both control sequences are comparable in terms of compensating for this
diversity, and as we saw in :numref:`fig_cas_stu1_energy`,
their energy consumption is not noticeably affected.

Improvement to Guideline 36 Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes improvements that we recommend for the Guideline 36
specification, based on the first public review draft :cite:`ASHRAE2016`.

.. _sec_fre_pro:

Freeze Protection for Mixed Air Temperature
...........................................

The sequences have no freeze protection for the mixed air temperature.

Guideline 36 states (emphasis added):

   If the supply air temperature drops below :math:`4.4^\circ \mathrm C` (:math:`40^\circ \mathrm F`) for :math:`5` minutes, send two
   (or more, as required to ensure that heating plant is active) Boiler Plant
   Requests, override the outdoor air damper to the minimum position, and
   *modulate the heating coil to maintain a supply air temperature* of at least :math:`5.6^\circ` C
   (:math:`42^\circ \mathrm F`). Disable this function when supply air temperature rises above :math:`7.2^\circ \mathrm C`
   (:math:`45^\circ \mathrm F`) for 5 minutes.

Depending on the outdoor air requirements, the mixed air temperature :math:`T_{mix}` may be below freezing,
which could freeze the heating coil if it has low water flow rate.
Note that the Guideline 36 sequence controls based on the supply air temperature and not the mixed air temperature.
Hence, this control would not have been active.


:numref:`fig_fre_pro` shows the mixed air temperature and the economizer control
signal for cold climate.
The trajectories whose subscripts end in *no* are without freeze protection control based
on the mixed air temperature, as is the case for Guideline 36,
whereas for the trajectories that end in *with*, we added freeze
protection that adjusts the economizer to limit the mixed air temperature.
For these simulations, we reduced the outdoor air temperature by
:math:`10` Kelvin (:math:`18` Fahrenheit) below the values obtained from the TMY3 weather data.
This caused in day 6 and 7 in :numref:`fig_fre_pro` sub-freezing mixed air temperatures
during day-time, as the outdoor air damper was open to provide sufficient fresh air.
We also observed that outside air is infiltrated through the AHU when the fan
is switched off.
This is because
the wind pressure on the building causes the building to be slightly below
the ambient pressure, thereby infiltrating air through the economizers closed
air dampers (that have some leakage).
This causes a mixed air temperatures below freezing at night when the fan is off.
Note that these temperatures are qualitative rather than quantitative results
as the model is quite simplified at these small flow rates, which are about
:math:`0.01\%` of the air flow rate that the model has when the fan is operating.

.. _fig_fre_pro:

.. figure:: img/case_study1/results/TMixFre.*

   Mixed air temperature and economizer control signal for Guideline 36 case with
   and without freeze protection.


We therefore recommend adding the following wordings to Guideline 36,
which is translated from :cite:`SteuernRegeln1986`:

Use a capillary sensor installed after the heating coil. If the temperature after the heating coil is below
:math:`4^\circ C`,

1. enable frost protection by opening the heating coil valve,
2. send frost alarm,
3. switch on pump of the heating coil.

The frost alarm requires manual confirmation.

If the temperature at the capillary sensor exceeds :math:`6^\circ C`,
close the valve but keep the pump running until the frost alarm is manually reset.
(Closing the valve avoids overheating).


Recknagel :cite:`Recknagel2005` adds further:

1. Add bypass at valve to ensure :math:`5\%` water flow.
2. In winter, keep bypass always open, possibly with thermostatically actuated valve.
3. If the HVAC system is off, keep the heating coil valve open to allow water flow
   if there is a risk of frost in the AHU room.
4. If the heating coil is closed,
   open the outdoor air damper with a time delay when fan switches on to allow heating coil valve to open.
5. For pre-heat coil, install a circulation pump to ensure full water flow rate through the coil.


.. _sec_dea_har_swi:

Deadbands for Hard Switches
...........................

There are various sequences in which the set point changes as a step function of
the control signal, such as shown in :numref:`fig_dam_val_reh`.
In our simulations of the VAV terminal boxes, the switch in air flow rate caused
chattering. We circumvented the problem by checking if the heating control signal
remains bigger than :math:`0.05` for :math:`5` minutes. If it falls below :math:`0.01`,
the timer was switched off. This avoids chattering.
We therefore recommend to be more explicit for
where to add hysteresis or time delays.

Averaging Air Flow Measurements
...............................

The Guideline 36 sequence does not seem to prescribe that outdoor airflow rate
measurements need to be time averaged. As such measurements can
fluctuate due to turbulence, we recommend to consider averaging
this measurement. In the simulations, we averaged the outdoor airflow
measurement over a :math:`5` second moving window (in the simulation,
this was done to avoid an algebraic system of equations,
but, in practice, this would filter measurement noise).


Cross-Referencing and Modularization
....................................

For citing individual sections or blocks of the Guideline,
it would be helpful if the Guideline where available at a permanent web site
as html, with a unique url and anchor to each section.
This would allow cross-referencing the Guideline from a particular implementation
in a way that allows the user to quickly see the original specification.

As part of such a restructuring, it would be helpful to the reader
to clearly state what are the input signals, what are configurable parameters,
such as the control gain, and what are the output signals.
This in turn would structure the Guideline into distinct modules,
for which one could also provide a reference implementation
in software.


Lessons Learned Regarding the Simulations
.........................................

A few lessons regarding simulating such systems
have been learned and are reported here. Note that related best practices
are also available at https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/userGuide/bestPractice.html

* *Fan with prescribed mass flow rate:* In earlier implementations, we
  converted the control signal for the fan to a mass flow rate, and used a fan
  model whose mass flow rate is equal to its control input, regardless of the pressure head.
  During start of the system, this caused a unrealistic large fan head
  of :math:`4000` Pa (:math:`16` inch of water) because
  the fan increased its mass flow rate faster than the VAV dampers opened.
  The large pressure drop also lead to large power consumption and hence unrealistic
  temperature increase across the fan.

* *Fan with prescribed pressure head:* We also tried to use a fan with prescribed pressure head.
  Similarly as above, the fan maintains the pressure head as obtained from its
  control signal, regardless of the volume flow rate.
  This caused unrealistic large flow rates in the return duct
  which has very small pressure drops. (Subsequently, we removed the return fan
  as it is not needed for this system.)

* *Time sampling certain physical calculations:* Dymola 2018FD01 uses the same
  time step for all continuous-time equations. Depending on the dynamics, this
  can be smaller than a second. Since some of the control samples every
  :math:`2` minutes, it has shown to be favorable to also time sample the
  computationally expensive simulation of the long-wave radiation network in the rooms.
  Because surface temperatures change slowly, computing it every :math:`2` minutes suffices.
  We expect further speed up can be achieved by time
  sampling other slow physical processes.

* *Non-convergence:* In earlier simulations, sometimes the solver failed to converge.
  This was due to errors in the control implementation that caused event iterations
  for discrete equations that seemed to have no solution.
  In another case, division by zero in the control implementation caused a problem.
  The solver found a way to work around this division by zero
  (using heuristics) but then failed to converge.
  Since we corrected these issues, the simulations are stable.

* *Too fast dynamics of coil:* The cooling coil is implemented using a finite volume model.
  Heat diffusion among the control volumes of the water and
  among the control volumes of air used to be neglected as the dominant
  mode of heat transfer is forced convection if the fan and pump are operating.
  However, during night when the system is off, the small infiltration due to wind pressure caused in
  earlier simulations the water in the coil to freeze. Adding diffusion
  circumvented this problem, and the coil model in the library includes now by default
  a small diffusive term.

Discussion and Conclusions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case study,
the Guideline 36 sequence reduced annual site HVAC energy use by :math:`30\%`
compared to the baseline implementation with comparable thermal comfort.
Such savings are significant, and have been achieved by changes in controls programming only
which can relatively easy be deployed in buildings.

Implementing the Guideline 36 sequence was, however, rather challenging due to its
complexity caused by the various mode changes, interlocks, timers and cascading control loops.
These mode changes, interlocks and dynamic dependencies
made verification of the correctness through inspection of the control signals difficult.
As a consequence, various programming errors and misinterpretations or ambiguities
of the Guideline were only discovered in closed loop simulations,
despite of having implemented open-loop test cases for each block of the sequence.
We therefore believe it is important to provide robust, validated
implementations of the sequences published in Guideline 36.
Such implementations would encapsulate the complexity and provide
assurances that energy modeler and control providers have correct implementations.
With the implementation in
the Modelica package 
`Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36 <https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v10.0.0/help/Buildings_Controls_OBC_ASHRAE_G36.html#Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36>`_,
we made
such an implementation and laid out the structure and conventions.

A key short-coming from an implementer point of view was that the
sequence was only available in English language, and as an implementation
in ALC EIKON of sequences that are "close to the currently used version of the
Guideline". Neither allowed a validation of the CDL implementation
because the English language version leaves room for interpretation (and cannot
be executed) and because EIKON has quite limited simulation support
that is cumbersome to use for testing the dynamic response of
control sequences for different input
trajectories. Therefore, a benefit of the Modelica implementation is that
such reference trajectories can now easily be generated to validate alternate
implementations.

A benefit of the simulation based assessment was that it allowed
detecting potential issues such as a mixed air temperature below the
freezing point (:numref:`sec_fre_pro`) and chattering due to hard switches
(:numref:`sec_dea_har_swi`).
Having a simulation model of the controlled process also allowed
verification of work-arounds for these issues.

One can, correctly, argue that the magnitude of the energy savings
are higher the worse the baseline control is. However, the baseline control was
carefully implemented, following our interpretation of
ASHRAE's Sequences of Operation for
Common HVAC Systems :cite:`ASHRAESeq2006:1`. While higher efficiency
of the baseline may be achieved through supply air temperature reset
or different economizer control, such potential improvements were only
recognized after seeing the results of the Guideline 36 sequence.
Thus, regardless of whether a building is using Guideline 36,
having a baseline control against which alternative implementations
can be compared and benchmarked is an immensely valuable feature
enabled by a library of standardized control sequences. Without a benchmark,
one can easily claim to have a good control, while not recognizing what
potential savings one may miss.
