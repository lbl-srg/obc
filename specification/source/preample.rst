Purpose of the Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document describes the development of the
Control Description Language (CDL)
that is being developed within the OpenBuildingControl project.
It also describes the process workflow,
use cases and requirements, as well as a case study that illustrates the use of CDL for
performance comparison of a control sequence during design.

The document is a working document that is used as a discussion basis
and will evolve as the development progresses.
