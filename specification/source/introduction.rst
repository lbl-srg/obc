Introduction
------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

More than 1 quad/yr of energy is wasted in the US because,
for most commercial building projects, control sequences are poorly specified and implemented.
The process to specify, implement and verify controls sequences is often only partially successful,
with efficiency being the most difficult part to accomplish.
This is particulary the case for
built-up HVAC systems, which require custom-control solutions and
which are common in large buildings.
For such systems, the current state is that, at best,
the mechanical designer specifies the building control sequences
in an English language specification. However, such a specification
cannot be tested formally for correctness.
It is also ambiguous, leaving room for different implementations,
including variants that were not intended by the designer or may not work
correctly.
The implementation of the sequences is often done by a controls
contractor who either attempts to implement the sequence as specified,
or use a sequence of a similar project that appears to have the same control intent.
During commissioning, the lack of an executable specification of the control sequence
against which the implementation can be tested makes commissioning of the
control sequences expensive and limited in terms of code coverage :cite:`GnerreFuller2017`.
Not surprisingly, programming errors are the dominating issue among control-related
problems that impact energy use in buildings :cite:`BarwigHouseEtAl2002`.

However, formal controls design and verification in other industries has led to
significant labor cost savings and performance improvements.


Project Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The overall goal of this project is to significantly improve the building energy efficiency
through a robust workflow that allows deploying at scale high performance building control sequence.
In support of this, the project developed a process
with an integrated set of tools to enable design engineers to unambiguously
specify energy-efficient control sequences for commercial buildings and
then verify their correct implementation, providing end-to-end quality control.


Approach
~~~~~~~~

Our approach is to digitize the control delivery. Rather than paper-based English language
specification, our process is fully digitized, allowing performance assessment in design,
electronic specification in a format that was designed to allow machine-to-machine translation to
control product lines, and formal verification of the control response relative
to its electronic specification.

Specifically, the project developed tools and process that allow for a digital control specification,
performance assessment using whole building energy simulation, and
delivery and implementation on existing building automation product lines.

The technical environment for such a digital control delivery starts to fall in place:
For communication of control signals, standards such as
BACnet, LonWorks and EIB/KNX are widely used.
For semantic modeling, Haystack and Brick are increasingly used, and
ASHRAE Standard 223P attempts to standardize semantic modeling, building on these
previous efforts.

   Overview of process for control sequence design, export of
   a specification, implementation on a control platform and verification
   against the specification.


However, what is missing is a means to express control sequences
in a way that can be simulated during design,
exported for control specification and documentation,
translated to commercial product lines and reused for formal verification of the correct
implementation of the control sequences. This gap is what the OpenBuildingControl project
attempts to close.
A key element of the OpenBuildingControl is the
Control Description Language (CDL) that has been developed in the project.
CDL is a declarative language for expressing control sequences through block diagram modeling.
To enable simulation of closed loop control as part of annual energy modeling during building design
or control research,
we designed CDL to be
a proper subset of the Modelica language, an open standard for an eqution-based object-oriented
modeling language :cite:`MattssonElmqvist1997:1,Modelica2012:1`.
As CDL is a declarative language,
the control specification can be exported in a vendor-independent json format
that serves as an intermediate format to produce English language documentation including point lists,
and that can serve as input to a code translator to a particular control product line.
The control specification can also be exported for use in a formal process that verifies
that the control signal of the actual implementation is within a user-selected tolerance
of the simulated control signal. This therefore provides a workflow with an end-to-end
verification as shown in :numref:`fig_cdl_overview`.
Therefore, CDL complements communication (BACnet) and semantic modeling (ASHRAE 223P) by
expressing the control logic, with the goal of standardizing this missing part of the
control representation.

We believe that the time for such an effort is ideal due to the convergence of various technologies
such as declarative modeling (Modelica) that allows closed loop control simulation in annual energy modeling,
advances in code generation that eases machine-to-machine translation of declarative languages,
semantic modeling (BRICK) that promises to generate a semantic model from a declarative Modelica model
for subsequent semi-automatical connection to an actual buildings in which a digital twin of the
control and of the building systems could be used to support building analytics (MORTAR~\cite{}).
Due to the trend towards all electric buildings, which, to increase 2nd law efficiency, should no longer
decouple subsystems through large temperature lifts (as is customary in fossil-fuel based heating systems),
and the resulting need for more complex control which, in addition, also need to provide grid flexibility,
we believe such a convergence of technology will help the industry achieving higher system-level performance.


Project Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project resulted in a process and a set of software tools that pave the way to a digitized control
delivery process. They enable the performance evaluation and improvement of building control sequences
using whole building energy simulation. Typical performance indices
are annual energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, peak demand and thermal comfort.
Such performance assessment can be done by researchers and control companies as part of developing
and evaluating new control sequences, or by mechanical designers as part of the building design process.
These control sequences can then be exported to a digital format for which we showed as a proof-of-concept
that it can be translated to a commercial building control platform, thereby running the control sequence
that was used in simulation natively on a commercial building control platform.
This intermediate format also allows control providers to build digital cost estimation tools, further
streamlining the control procurement process.

As part of the project, we demonstrated each step of such a digitized control design, delivery and
verification process. We also started forming an ASHRAE Standards Committee whose purpose is to
turn the Control Description Language that has been developed in this project into an ASHRAE/ANSI standard.
Such a standard will then complete existing standards for building control *communication* (BACnet),
emerging standards for *semantic* data (ASHRAE 223P) with a standard that allows expressing the
control *logic* in a way that is indepedent of a particular control product line.

The potential site energy savings of this project, if adopted widely,
are estimated to be nationally
0.254 quads (74.4 TWh) of electricity and
0.135 quads (39.6 TWh) of gas.
In California, the potential site energy savings would be
0.254 quads (74.4 TWh) of electricity and
0.135 quads (39.6 TWh) of gas.

If we assume 75% adoption of OpenBuildingControl over the next ten years, a controls retrofit rate of 10%/yr and
a new building construction rate of 1.5%/yr,
then, after 10 years, the amount of building stock that is impacted by OpenBuildingControl is 21%.
This would result in estimated benefits of $95M/yr for California IOU ratepayers.

The next sections provide more details about the results of this project.
They are structured as follows:

:numref:`sec_process` describes the overall process from control design to performance assessment,
export of control specification, cost-estimation, implementation by a control vendor and formal verification of the
implemented control sequences relative to the design specifications.

:numref:`sec_cdl` describes the Control Description Language (CDL), which is the key technology developed in this project.
This language is used to express control sequences digitally and in English language, in a format that is then translated
for simulation, for cost estimation, and for implementation in control product lines. This section is rather technical,
and is mainly of interest to developer who implement tools that use CDL. Less technical readers may skip this section.

:numref:`sec_con_lib` describes how the CDL language has been used to implement libraries of ready-to-use control sequence
that can be used within the process described in :numref:`sec_process`.

:numref:`sec_code_gen` describes various paths of how CDL can be translated for use in building control systems,
respecting the need for reusing existing control product lines, but also showing how established and emerging standards could be used
to streamline this process if a control provider develops a new control product line.

:numref:`sec_verification` describes how to formally verify that a control sequence that is implemented on a real
control hardware conforms to the CDL specification. It presents an actual example that illustrates the verification,
and closes with specifications for how to automate such a verification.

:numref:`sec_example` presents an example in which we compared the annual energy peformance of two different control sequences
applied to the same building and HVAC system. In this example, simply changing the control sequence led to about
30% annual savings in HVAC site electricity use.

:numref:`sec_benefit_rate_payers` describes the benefits to the California IOU rate payers.

:numref:`sec_glossary` explains technical terms used throughout the report.
